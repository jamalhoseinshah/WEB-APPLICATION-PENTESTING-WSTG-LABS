###  Test by passing authentication 

Broken Authentication is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to get into a web application without proper credentials.

This could be carried out either by bypassing the authentication mechanism put in place or by brute-forcing another user’s account.

If the attacker successfully bypasses or brute-forces his way into another user’s account, they gain access to all the data and privileges of that user account.

According to the OWASP Top 10 2021 report, broken authentication is ranked number 7 and is grouped under Identification and Authentication Failures.

This category slipped down from second place and now contains Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) relating to identification issues. It was previously known as broken authentication.

The severity of this vulnerability can be so high. Say, an attacker was able to brute-force his way into the administrator account of a web application, this means he gets full control over the web application.

This article seeks to demonstrate how an attacker tests for broken authentication in a web application and how to prevent them.

## How to test: 
open target online shopping website and login with any user name and password with intercept by burp suite . After inspect in burp suite user name and password. by using payload you can apply in order to find password by this procedure if password is weak then you will easily find out password if password is listed in rockyou or wordlist. 


## Prevention of broken authentication

Don’t expose sessions IDs in URLs - Session fixation attack is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to hijack a user session.

Don’t give room for user enumeration - It’s critical to utilize identical, generic error messages and to double-check that they’re the same. With every login request, you should return the same HTTP status code.

Implement a strong password policy - Allowing the use of weak and well-known passwords is not a good idea. After a given number of login attempts, require users to pass a 
CAPTCHA test.

brute-force protection - prevent brute-force login attempts.

Multi-factor authentication - provides an extra layer of security for users.

## Conclusion

To summarize, we have gone through how to set up an OWASP Juice shop. We have also earned how to test for broken authentication in web applications, the impact and prevention of broken authentication applications.

Broken authentication is a vulnerability that must be prevented by all means. Ensuring you have a proper and secured authentication mechanism is very important.
